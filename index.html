                <p>Hello everyone! I am James Bajamundi and I am a student at UC Davis Coding Bootcamp.
                I was born in 1998, in Quezon City, Philippines and later on moved to America with my family in 2009 when I was 
                about 10 years old. Currently, I am living in Sacramento, California, working at Pavilion Car Care
                as a detailer.</p>

                <p>I graduated high school back in 2016 from Sacred Heart Cathedral, a private school located in 
                San Francisco. My hobbies include playing the piano, violin, guitar, and ukulele, recording hymns
                in my room, and playing volleyball and badminton.</p>
